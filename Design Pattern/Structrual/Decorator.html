    <h1> JavaScript Design pattern: 
      <ul>
        <li>
          Creational - Decorator
          <ul>
              <li>
                Add aditional functionality to an object dynamically.
              </li>
              <li>
                  An example of a decorator is security management where business objects are 
                  given additional access to privileged information depending on the privileges of 
                  the authenticated user. For example, an HR manager gets to work with 
                  an employee object that has appended (i.e. is decorated with) the employee's 
                  salary record so that salary information can be viewed.  
              </li>
              <li>
                  alternative in Javscript is extend and mixin.
              </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <script>
        let user = function(name) {
          this.name = name
          this.describe = function() {
            console.log('name   ' + this.name)
          }
        }

        let decoratedUser = function(user, salary) {
          this.salary = salary
          this.name = user.name
          this.user =user

          this.describe = function() {
            console.log('salary   ' + this.salary + '   name   ' + this.name)
          }
        }

        let Behrooz = new user('Behrooz');
        let decortatedBehrooz = new decoratedUser(Behrooz, 10)

        Behrooz.describe()
        decortatedBehrooz.describe()
      </script>
